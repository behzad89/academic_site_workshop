## a bit about me:
I am a Geographic Information System (GIS) Analyst, with skills in developing scripts, models, and applications for processing, analyzing, and visualizing geospatial data and remotely sensed imagery. I am interested in finding intelligent solutions to geoprocessing and spatial analysis problems, and able to resolve problems with complex workflows and processing large datasets.

With an academic background in Geoinformatics (to masters level), I have an enthusiasm for working in Geospatial data modeling in the field of natural disasters, and also anything related to my passion to utilize Artificial Intelligent  in Geography(GeoAI).

Open source technologies are my preference, and mainly work with the Python and R programming languages; GIS and data analysis libraries such as GDAL/OGR, numpy, PyProj, sp, shapely, geopandas, pandas, matplotlib etc; and software such as QGIS and GRASS GIS, although I also have experience working with commercial software such as ESRI ArcGIS and its arcpy modules.

In addition to GIS, I also have skills in data science. I can carry out data acquisition, processing and analysis; standalone Python and R scripts; database management and SQL queries. I always approach my job with great interest and Iâ€™m committed to deliver high quality results on time and motivated to excel beyond expectations.
