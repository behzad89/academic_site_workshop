## a bit about me:
I am research assistance in **Environmental Exposure Science** at EEH [Environmental Exposures and Health](https://www.swisstph.ch/en/about/eph/environmental-exposures-and-health/) Unit of Swiss TPH Institute (Basel University). My PhD project **Spatio-temporal modeling of exposure to airborne pollen** is funded by the [European Research Council](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/853568). It aims to model the day-to-day and geographic variations of pollen in different climatic regions of Switzerland. I will use these models to estimate people’s exposure to airborne pollen for subsequent epidemiological research into a diversity of health effects. During the modeling process, I am working work with measured pollen concentrations, weather data, geographic datasets and satellite observations to improve pollen exposure mapping.

I also have experience as a Geographic Information System (GIS) Analyst, with skills in developing scripts, models, and applications for processing, analyzing, and visualizing geospatial data and remotely sensed imagery. I am interested in finding intelligent solutions to geoprocessing and spatial analysis problems, and able to resolve problems with complex workflows and processing large datasets.

Open-source technologies are my preference, and mainly work with the Python and R programming languages; GIS and data analysis libraries such as GDAL/OGR, numpy, PyProj, sp, shapely, geopandas, pandas, matplotlib etc; and software such as QGIS and GRASS GIS, although I also have experience working with commercial software such as ESRI ArcGIS and its arcpy modules.

In addition to GIS, I also have skills in data science. I can carry out data acquisition, processing and analysis; standalone Python and R scripts; database management and SQL queries. I always approach my job with great interest and I’m committed to delivering high-quality results on time and motivated to excel beyond expectations.
