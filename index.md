## a bit about me:
I am doing my PhD in **Environmental Exposure Science** at EEH [Environmental Exposures and Health](https://www.swisstph.ch/en/about/eph/environmental-exposures-and-health/) Unit of Swiss TPH institute (Basel University). My PhD project **Spatiotemporal modelling of exposure to airborne pollen** is funded by the [European Research Council](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/853568). It aims to model the day-to-day and geographic variations of pollen in different climatic regions of Switzerland. I will use these models to estimate people’s exposure to airborne pollen for subsequent epidemiological research into a diversity of health effects. During the modelling process, I am working work with measured pollen concentrations, weather data, geographic datasets and satellite observations to improve pollen exposure mapping.

I also have experience as a Geographic Information System (GIS) Analyst, with skills in developing scripts, models, and applications for processing, analyzing, and visualizing geospatial data and remotely sensed imagery. I am interested in finding intelligent solutions to geoprocessing and spatial analysis problems, and able to resolve problems with complex workflows and processing large datasets.

With an academic background in Geoinformatics (to masters level), I have an enthusiasm for working in Geospatial data modeling in the field of natural disasters, and also anything related to my passion to utilize Artificial Intelligent  in Geography(GeoAI).

Open source technologies are my preference, and mainly work with the Python and R programming languages; GIS and data analysis libraries such as GDAL/OGR, numpy, PyProj, sp, shapely, geopandas, pandas, matplotlib etc; and software such as QGIS and GRASS GIS, although I also have experience working with commercial software such as ESRI ArcGIS and its arcpy modules.

In addition to GIS, I also have skills in data science. I can carry out data acquisition, processing and analysis; standalone Python and R scripts; database management and SQL queries. I always approach my job with great interest and I’m committed to deliver high quality results on time and motivated to excel beyond expectations.
